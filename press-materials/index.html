    <h2>Long Bio</h2>
    <p>On <em>A New Kind of Hat</em>, the new long-player from Massachusetts's own Jake McKelvie, indie-rock melodicism slow dances with alt-country ramble. A kind soul that's just a touch world-weary, McKelvie's careful economy of language belies a sly sense of humor set against a backdrop of unadorned instrumentation.</p>

    <p>Thematically, the record strikes the perfect balance between serious musing and whimsy. With his band of in-the-pocket players at his side, McKelvie has crafted a record that is equally at home in the listening room as on the dance floor. Eminently engaging and full of nuance, <em>A New Kind of Hat</em> is a record destined for a treasured spot in your collection.</p>

    <p>Jake McKelvie has been writing songs and performing them since his teens. With his band The Countertops he's released three full length records and toured relentlessly to support them. His last proper solo effort was 2016's Rhinestone Busboy.</p>

    <p>This time around, McKelvie has decided to file the new record in the “solo project” bin. “The Countertops are known for energetic live shows and goofy stage behavior, whereas as a solo act I do more of the folk singer thing” he explains. “This new record floats somewhere in between those two things.”</p>

    <p>Written over the years in myriad apartments and tour vans throughout the northeast and beyond, McKelvie turned to Grain Thief's Mike Harmon and his studio Wachusett Recording to track the record. In addition to McKelvie, the record features appearances by Michael Holland on bass, and Countertops drummer Matt Bacon. Keith Dusoe makes a cameo on pedal steel. It was mixed by Harmon and Roger Lavallee.</p>

    <p>There's a lot here if you really listen &mdash; but you can just as well hum and tap along.</p>

    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <p>Jake McKelvie has traveled the DIY touring circuit in the US and UK for over a decade, carving out a niche for himself as a songwriter and performer. Known for his off-kilter and whimsical "stream of self-consciousness" lyricism and charming stage demeanor, he keeps audiences engaged both as a solo performer or with his newly minted backing band, “the New Old Band". This year will see the release of a new LP and a slew of tour dates to coincide with it.</p>
